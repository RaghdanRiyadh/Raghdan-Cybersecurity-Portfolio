### Section 1: Network Protocol Identification

During the analysis of website traffic using the Tcpdump tool, it was determined that the website was utilizing the HTTP protocol on port 80 with TCP hand-shake. HTTP is an insecure protocol as it does not employ encryption, leaving the data exchanged between the website and clients vulnerable to interception and tampering.

### Section 2: Incident Documentation

The incident in question involves a brute force attack on the admin account of the website yummyrecipesforme.com. The attack was initiated by a former employee who successfully guessed the admin account password, which was still set to the default.

Once the attacker gained access to the admin account, they injected a malicious JavaScript function into the website’s source code. This code prompted visitors to download and execute a file under the pretense of a browser update. Upon downloading the file, users were redirected to a fraudulent website, greatrecipesforme.com, which hosted malware. This malware caused significant slowdowns on the personal computers of affected users.

To investigate, I created a sandbox environment to safely observe the website’s behavior. Using Tcpdump for network analysis, I accessed the website yummyrecipesforme.com. Upon loading the page, I was prompted to download an executable file. After allowing the file to run, I observed a browser redirect to the malicious site greatrecipesforme.com, confirming the presence of malware.

Through these analyses and inspections, we confirmed that the website was compromised via a JavaScript code injection attack.

### Section 3: Remediation Recommendation for Brute Force Attacks

To mitigate the risk of brute force attacks, it is recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). MFA enhances security by requiring two or more verification steps before granting access to an account. Additionally, other secure methods such as One-Time Passwords (OTP) or Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) should be employed to further strengthen account security.
