# Controls and compliance checklist

To complete the controls assessment checklist, refer to the information provided in the scope, goals, and risk assessment report. For more details about each control, including the type and purpose, refer to the control categories document.

Then, select “yes” or “no” to answer the question: Does Botium Toys currently have this control in place? 

## Controls assessment checklist

| Yes / No / ? | Control | Explanation |
|--------------|---------|-------------|
|  NO  | Least Privilege | The principle of least privilege is not enforced at Botium Toys, granting all employees unrestricted access to internal data, including cardholder data and customers’ PII/SPII. This lack of control violates the security procedures outlined in the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF).|
| NO   | Disaster recovery | The company lacks a disaster recovery plan, posing a significant risk to business continuity in the event of a disaster, such as a power outage. Without a plan, the company is vulnerable to extended downtime and operational disruptions.|
| NO| Passowrd Policies| While a password policy exists, it does not meet the minimum complexity requirements, compromising overall security.|
|NO| Separation of duties| There is no separation of duties, with managers and workers sharing the same level of access to sensitive assets. This lack of segregation poses a risk, as it makes it difficult to identify the source of a breach should one occur. It is critical that access to data storage, particularly PII/SPII, be restricted based on role.|
|YES| Firewall | A firewall is in place and effectively blocks traffic according to a well-defined set of security rules.| 
|NO|  IDS| The absence of an IDS leaves the IT team unable to detect potential intrusions by threat actors, increasing the risk of undetected security breaches.|
|NO|Backups| The company has no backup system in place, which poses a significant risk. Any data loss could severely disrupt business continuity and lead to financial losses.|
|YES|Antivirus| software is installed and regularly monitored by the IT department, which is crucial in protecting the company, as employees are often the most vulnerable point of entry for cyber threats.|
|NO|Monitoring and Maintenance| Manual monitoring, maintenance, and intervention are required for legacy systems, which can be resource-intensive and prone to human error.|
|NO|Encryption| Currently, customer credit card information is not encrypted, leaving the company non-compliant with NIST CSF regulations. In the event of a data breach, this lack of encryption could result in the exposure of sensitive information and significant financial penalties.|
|NO|Password Management System| There is no centralized password management system, which hampers productivity when handling password recovery or reset requests.
|YES|Locks (offices, storefront, warehouse)|
|YES|Closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance|
|YES|Fire detection/prevention (fire alarm, sprinkler system, etc.)| 

## Compliance Checklist

### Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)

| Yes / No / ? | Control | Explanation |
|--------------|---------|-------------|
| No           | Only authorized users have access to customers’ credit card information. | The company does not restrict access to customer credit card information, allowing all employees to access it, which increases the risk of unauthorized use or breaches. |
| No           | Credit card information is stored, accepted, processed, and transmitted internally, in a secure environment. | The current environment lacks adequate security controls, making the handling of credit card data vulnerable to unauthorized access and non-compliance with industry standards. |
| No           | Implement data encryption procedures to better secure credit card transaction touchpoints and data. | Data encryption is not implemented, leaving credit card transactions and stored data at risk of being compromised if intercepted or accessed by unauthorized individuals. |
| No           | Adopt secure password management policies. | The existing password policy does not meet the minimum complexity requirements, increasing the likelihood of weak passwords being exploited by attackers. |

### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
| Yes / No / ? | Control | Explanation |
|--------------|---------|-------------|
|NO| E.U. customers’ data is kept private/secured.|This indicates that the company currently does not effectively protect the privacy and security of EU customers' data. There may be vulnerabilities or weaknesses in their data protection measures.|
|YES| There is a plan in place to notify E.U. customers within 72 hours if their data is compromised/there is a breach.|This shows that the company has a defined procedure to inform EU customers promptly in case of a data breach, fulfilling a crucial GDPR requirement.|
|NO|Ensure data is properly classified and inventoried.|This suggests that the company lacks a system for categorizing and documenting their data, which is essential for understanding and managing data protection risks.|
|NO|Enforce privacy policies, procedures, and processes to properly document and maintain data.|This implies that the company does not have established guidelines or practices for handling and managing data, which can lead to inconsistencies and potential breaches.|

### System and Organizations Controls (SOC type 1, SOC type 2) 
| Yes / No / ? | Control | Explanation |
|--------------|---------|-------------|
|NO|User access policies are established.|This indicates that the company currently does not have defined policies for managing user access to systems and data. This lack of control can increase the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.|
|NO|Sensitive data (PII/SPII) is confidential/private.| This suggests that the company does not have adequate measures in place to protect sensitive data, such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Sensitive Personal Information (SPII). This could lead to privacy violations and data breaches.|
|NO|Data integrity ensures the data is consistent, complete, accurate, and has been validated.|This implies that the company does not have processes in place to maintain the accuracy and integrity of its data. Inaccurate or incomplete data can lead to incorrect decisions and operational issues.|
|NO|Data is available to individuals authorized to access it.|This indicates that the company does not have proper access controls in place to restrict data access to authorized individuals only. This increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure and misuse of data.|
